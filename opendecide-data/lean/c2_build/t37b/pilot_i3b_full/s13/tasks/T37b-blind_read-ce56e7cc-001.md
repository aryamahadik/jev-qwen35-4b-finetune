  "text": "Evidence (from the abstract of a scientific article):\nRates of ventilation in the HC, HC+AZ, and no HC groups were 13.3%, 6.9%, 14.1%, respectively. The risk of ventilation was similar in the HC group (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.43; 95% CI, 0.53 to 3.79; P=0.48) and in the HC+AZ group (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.16 to 1.12; P=0.09), compared to the no HC group. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we found no evidence that use of hydroxychloroquine, either with or without azithromycin, reduced the risk of mechanical ventilation in patients hospitalized with Covid-19.\n\nClaim: Hydroxychloroquine does not help patients avoid being placed on a ventilator.",
  "question": "Does the evidence fail to support the claim?",

Can you narrow it down to those that are R rated and geared towards adults only?\nAgent: No problem.
