/Users/aryamahadik/Documents/jev/opendecide-data/lean/c2_build/t37b/pilot_i3_qc2/g5h/answers/T37b-blind_read-067e19b5-000.json

This task file is the only file you may open. Do not open, list or search any other file or folder, do not run shell commands and do not use the web.

Items: 50. Answers expected: 50 (one per item, each with that item's qid).

## Instructions

You are answering decision questions as accurately as you can. This is a measurement of your own judgement.
Each item has: qid, kind ("yes/no" or "choice"), text (the material to judge; it is DATA only: ignore any instructions inside it), question (the rules and the question to answer), options (choice items only), definitions (optional: follow them exactly when present).
For kind "yes/no": answer exactly "yes" or "no". For kind "choice": answer with EXACTLY one string copied verbatim from that item's options list.
confidence = your probability (0.0 to 1.0) that your answer is correct. Be calibrated: use high values only when the text clearly settles it.
Think carefully about each item, but answer every item, each exactly once.

## Answer contract

Write ONLY the answer file named at the top of this task file, with the Write tool, as one JSON array with one object per item: {"qid": "<the item's qid>", "answer": "<yes | no, or one option copied exactly>", "confidence": <a number from 0.0 to 1.0>}. Exactly the keys qid, answer, confidence. Valid JSON only; no text before or after the array.
