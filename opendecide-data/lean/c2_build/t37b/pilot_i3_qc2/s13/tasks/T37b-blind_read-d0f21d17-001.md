  "question": "Hey, does this paragraph say the contrarian climate claim that climate science or the climate movement is unreliable?",
  "definitions": "- yes: The paragraph itself asserts or argues (in its own voice, not just quoting someone to rebut them) the contrarian claim that climate science or the climate movement is unreliable: it attacks the reliability of climate science or its proponents: the data, models, methods or consensus are uncertain, unsound or manipulated; scientists, the IPCC, activists, media or politicians are alarmist, biased, hypocritical, corrupt or part of a conspiracy.\n- no: The paragraph does not make this contrarian claim: it gives background, neutral description or mainstream statements, or it makes a different kind of argument (for example about policy costs rather than the science, or vice versa) without claiming that climate science or the climate movement is unreliable."

  "question": "Does the evidence fail to support the claim?",
