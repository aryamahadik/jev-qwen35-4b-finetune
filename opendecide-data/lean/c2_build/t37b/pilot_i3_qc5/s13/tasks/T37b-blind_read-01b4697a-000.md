WHEN THE VEHICLE IS MOVING, THE RISK OF THE OPERATOR'S OVEREXPOSURE TO THE HEAT CAN BE REDUCED BY ROLLING DOWN THE WINDOWS.

WHEN MY OVEREXPOSURE TO THE HEAT CAUSED ME TO BECOME FAINT AND DISORIENTED, I ABANDONED MY VEHICLE ON THE INTERSTATE AND MADE MY WAY TO THE SHOULDER OF THE INTERSTATE. A DOCTOR CAUGHTUP IN THE TRAFFIC BACKUP SAW ME AND WHILE ATTENDING ME STATED THAT I WAS SUFFERING FROM HEAT EXHAUSTION.
