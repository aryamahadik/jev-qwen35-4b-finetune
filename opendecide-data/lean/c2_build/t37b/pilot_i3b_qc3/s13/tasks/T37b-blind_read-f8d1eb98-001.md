  "definitions": "- yes: The paragraph itself asserts or argues (in its own voice, not just quoting someone to rebut them) the contrarian claim that climate solutions won't work: it argues against climate solutions: climate policies (carbon taxes, cap-and-trade, treaties such as Kyoto or Paris, regulations) are harmful to the economy, jobs or the poor, or are ineffective or flawed; clean energy technology or biofuels cannot work; people need fossil-fuel (or nuclear) energy.\n- no: The paragraph does not make this contrarian claim: it gives background, neutral description or mainstream statements, or it makes a different kind of argument (for example about policy costs rather than the science, or vice versa) without claiming that climate solutions won't work."
