# T06 extraction task T06-extract_g3h-ddbc9490-005

ANSWER FILE (write your whole answer here, and nowhere else, with the Write tool):
/Users/aryamahadik/Documents/jev/opendecide-data/lean/c2_build/families/T06/haiku/extract/answers/T06-extract_g3h-ddbc9490-005.json

Task: extract_g3h; g3h-r1; items: 32; outputs expected: 32.

How to work: this task file is the only file you may open. Do not open, list or search any other file or folder. Write your whole answer, and nothing else, as one JSON document to the ANSWER FILE path given at the top of this file, with the Write tool. Inside JSON strings, write a double quote as \" and a line break as \n.

TASK: READ ONE MESSAGE and extract three fields from it. Each item gives a TEXT (a short customer message, with its values
already written in) and a SCHEMA with three fields:
- customer: the person who wants to send the goods back, copied exactly as written in the TEXT.
- item: the goods the person bought, copied exactly as written in the TEXT, without any article (a, an, the, my) or
  possessive before it.
- store: the store the goods came from, copied exactly as written in the TEXT.

Rules: copy exactly; do not correct spelling; do not infer anything. If a field's value is not written in the TEXT,
write NONE. Answer every item exactly once.

Answer format: one JSON array with one object per item (every item answered once):
[{"qid": "<qid of the item>", "customer": "<copied>", "item": "<copied>", "store": "<copied>"}, ...]
Copy each qid exactly.

ITEMS (JSON; answer every item, keyed by its qid):
