ANSWER FILE (write your whole answer here, and nowhere else, with the Write tool):
/Users/aryamahadik/Documents/jev/opendecide-data/lean/c2_build/families/T07/haiku/redo2/extract/answers/T07-extract_g3h-918cfd16-003.json

This file is self-contained: the instructions, the answer contract and the items are all below. Read this whole file. Do not open, list or search any other file or folder.

ANSWER CONTRACT (exact; a program checks it):
- The answer file holds one JSON array with exactly 40 objects: one per item below, each item answered once.
- Each object has exactly two keys: "qid" and "extraction". No other keys.
- "qid": copy the item's qid exactly. The qids of this task: q8d0fea974e, q41dd8912bc, q49353c5a06, q88372777e9, q3bf6992fa1, qaeb29e6504, q2335c28941, q669b5595ca, q42db45523f, q3722698ca1, qcb4cb2809a, q866873a9c8, q4535aa768a, qdea61afa33, qf2613fa170, q16ebdca6dd, qa6f5fad265, qbb3908a064, q154d3bceaa, q84e228a138, qcccdca0ec7, qf9025407b9, qbee8634de7, q552dc4c132, q6704f5387d, q0e3e500d2b, q0b84d3d264, q4d3d11d96b, qdf90bc9695, q8aec7b1cc4, q9e800aa024, q29b34fd3a3, q2d32785610, q37da49b058, q3c740f2d9c, q5e9e477327, q8f2c701c8d, q8622674a8a, q9e28b43632, qc9632ca5cb.
- "extraction": one JSON object with every schema field name of the item, and no other name.
- Valid JSON only: no text before or after the array, no markdown code fences, no comments.
Literal shape: [{"qid": "q8d0fea974e", "extraction": {"store": "...", "region_rule": "...", "region_bound": null, ...}}, ...]

Task kind: extract_g3h; read redo2-g3h; items: 40; outputs expected: 40.

## Instructions

TASK: FILL IN THE FIELDS OF ONE ADVERTISEMENT TEXT.

Each item has a "text" (a short advertisement; its fine print is one line that starts with a star, *) and a "schema"
(the fields to fill, each with a description and, for some, the choices allowed). Read the text on its own and fill
every field from the text only.

- "store": the name of the store that runs the advertisement, copied as written.
- a field ending in "_rule": copy one of its listed choices exactly. Use "absent" when the text states no rule of that
  kind.
- a field ending in "_bound": copy the value that the rule names, exactly as written in the text (a date, an amount, a
  category or a level name). Use null when the rule is absent.

Do not guess a value the text does not state. Do not correct spelling or change the wording. Judge each item on its own.

Output: one JSON array with exactly one object per item, keyed by the item's "qid":
[{"qid": "...", "extraction": {"store": "...", "region_rule": "...", "region_bound": null, ...}}]
Use every schema field name exactly, and no other names. No text outside the JSON.
Write the whole answer with the Write tool to the ANSWER FILE named in your task file, and nowhere else.

## Items (40; answer every item, keyed by its qid)
