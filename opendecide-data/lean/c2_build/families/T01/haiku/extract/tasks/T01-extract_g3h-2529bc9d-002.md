# T01 extraction task T01-extract_g3h-2529bc9d-002

ANSWER FILE (write your whole answer here, and nowhere else, with the Write tool):
/Users/aryamahadik/Documents/jev/opendecide-data/lean/c2_build/families/T01/haiku/extract/answers/T01-extract_g3h-2529bc9d-002.json

Task kind: extract_g3h; read: g3h-r1; items: 38; outputs expected: 38.

How to work: this task file is the only file you may open. Do not open, list or search any other file or folder. Write your whole answer, and nothing else, as one JSON document to the ANSWER FILE path given at the top of this file, with the Write tool. Inside JSON strings, write a double quote as \" and a line break as \n.

TASK: READ ONE DOCUMENT and extract three fields from it. Each item gives a TEXT (a short free-form note: a memo, an
e-mail, a chat message, a ticket or a transcript) and a SCHEMA with three fields:
- person: the full personal name of the person who wrote the note or is named in it as the sender, copied exactly as
  written in the TEXT.
- ref: the reference code (letters, a hyphen and digits) for the file, case or notice, copied exactly as written in the
  TEXT.
- topic: the phrase that says what the note is about, copied exactly as written in the TEXT, without the word "the"
  in front of it.

Rules: copy exactly; do not correct spelling; do not infer anything; if a field is not in the TEXT, write NONE;
answer every item exactly once.

Answer format: one JSON array with one object per item (every item answered once):
[{"qid": "<qid of the item>", "person": "<name copied as written>", "ref": "<reference copied as written>",
  "topic": "<phrase copied as written>"}, ...]
Copy each qid exactly.

ITEMS (JSON; answer every item, keyed by its qid):
