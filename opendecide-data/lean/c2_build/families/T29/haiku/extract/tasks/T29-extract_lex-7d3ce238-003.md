# T29 extraction task T29-extract_lex-7d3ce238-003

ANSWER FILE (write your whole answer here, and nowhere else, with the Write tool):
/Users/aryamahadik/Documents/jev/opendecide-data/lean/c2_build/families/T29/haiku/extract/answers/T29-extract_lex-7d3ce238-003.json

Task kind: extract_lex; read: glex-r2; items: 50; outputs expected: 50.

How to work: this task file is the only file you may open. Do not open, list or search any other file or folder. Write your whole answer, and nothing else, as one JSON document to the ANSWER FILE path given at the top of this file, with the Write tool. Inside JSON strings, write a double quote as \" and a line break as \n.

TASK: READ EACH TEXT ALONE and pick the ONE CHOICE whose meaning the text expresses. Each item gives a TEXT (one short
phrase or sentence, with its values already filled in) and CHOICES (a list of meanings).

Rules:
1. Use only the TEXT and its CHOICES. Do not guess beyond the words, and do not add a condition, a default or any
   fact from outside the text.
2. Copy the chosen CHOICE exactly, character for character, from that item's own list. Never write a new meaning.
3. Answer every item exactly once.
Answer format: one JSON array with one object per item (every item answered once):
[{"qid": "<qid of the item>", "meaning": "<the chosen choice, copied exactly>"}, ...]
Copy each qid exactly.

ITEMS (JSON; answer every item, keyed by its qid):
