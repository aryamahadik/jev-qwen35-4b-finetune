# T12 extraction task T12-extract_g3h-4e9ec113-000

ANSWER FILE (write your whole answer here, and nowhere else, with the Write tool):
/Users/aryamahadik/Documents/jev/opendecide-data/lean/c2_build/families/T12/haiku/extract/answers/T12-extract_g3h-4e9ec113-000.json

Task kind: extract_g3h; items: 34; answer fields: clerk, dept.

This task file is the only file you may open. Do not open, list or search any other file or folder.

## Instructions

You read a short free-text note from an accounts-payable team. Each item has a "text" (the note) and a "schema" listing the fields to extract. For each item, return every field's value as the note states it: "clerk" is the full name of the person the note is from or to, copied exactly as written; "dept" is the team the purchase is for, copied as the note writes it (one of the listed "choices" when the schema gives choices). Do not add facts, and do not fill in a value the note does not give. Answer every item once; no item may be skipped or repeated.

OUTPUT. Write ONLY the answer file named at the top of this task file, with the Write tool, as one JSON array in the answer format below, one entry per item. No other file, no other text.

Answer format: [{"qid": "<qid>", "clerk": "<full name>", "dept": "<team as written>"}, ...]

## Items (JSON; answer every item once, keyed by its qid)
