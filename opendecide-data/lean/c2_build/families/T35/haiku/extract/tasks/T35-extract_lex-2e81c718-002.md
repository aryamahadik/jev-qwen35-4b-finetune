Items: 50.

You are checking short sentences for a synthetic dataset about web crawlers. Each item gives a
text (a question, or a rule sentence from a card of rules for reading a robots.txt file; a sample value may be filled
in) and a list of choices, each one possible meaning. Pick the ONE choice that states exactly what the text means:
not a broader, narrower or softer meaning. If no choice fits exactly, answer "none of these".

How to work: this task file is the only file you may open. Do not open, list or search any other file or folder.
Write your whole answer, and nothing else, as one JSON document to the ANSWER FILE path given at the top of this file,
with the Write tool.
Answer format: one JSON array with one object per item (every item answered once):
[{"qid": "<qid of the item>", "meaning": "<the chosen choice, copied exactly, or none of these>"}, ...]
Copy each qid exactly.

ITEMS (JSON; answer every item, keyed by its qid):
